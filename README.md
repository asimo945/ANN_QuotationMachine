# ANN_PriceOptimizer
Setting an optimised price for a product is difficult, but essential! The difficulties in setting an optimize price could be due to the following factors: global competition, time consuming coast estimation process, informed consumers and low-cost disruptions. The traditional rule-based pricing system is suffering in time-consuming manual pricing, relies on rule-based expertise, also such a method may also inefficient due to frequent adjustment of the product design.  The project aimed to develop a price optimisation system based on historical data, in which an automatic pricing system with minimum maintenance and statistical confidence should able be achieved.
